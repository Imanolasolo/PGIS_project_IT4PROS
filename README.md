# PGIS Project - IT4PROS

## First approach

Project created to cover the Capstone project for Holberton School.

The objective is to create a georreferencing webpage widget for SIS VIDA company sited in Colombia, where appears the health giving institutions who match the user queries, all of those institutions appear in a responsive web embedded map.

This project will be the MVP of the Capstone project for Holberton School Full Stack Engineer course ending.

We have build our codebase in three differnet repositories to cover all the documentation and codebase of the project to make it more coomprehensive. Check for the links below:
